# PowerShell

## Version 1.1 
#### Released 17-Dec-2015

[V1.1 Release Notes]()

Collection of scripts, functions, and examples using the SolidFire Tools for PowerShell.

The SolidFire PowerShell Tools are now generally available! You can access them in the Install directory of this repo or through SolidFire Support's FTP site.

This repository serves as a space for development on various scripts and functions to assist in managing SolidFire systems using PowerShell.  All scripts and functions are delivered as is and are not directly supported by SolidFire support.  If you have a question about a script or function, or have a need not already presented in this repository, please feel free to email us at powershell@solidfire.com or talk with us on the SolidFire developer community at developer.solidfire.com.

All scripts and functions will leverage the SolidFire PowerShell Tools.  Some scripts or functions may also leverage other PowerShell tools such as VMware's PowerCLI or Cisco's UCSPowerTool.  Scripts or functions using other modules or snapins will be noted.
